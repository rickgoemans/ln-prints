Any print you want will come out on the front: photographic or painterly, in 1 color or in thousands of colors, large or small, it doesn\'t matter anything is possible!<br>During the process, the fabric only gets more beautiful. The colors adhere to the fabric and the fiber returns to its original, optimal shape. And voila! A new idea has been realized on fabric. Ready to be incorporated into clothing, to cover a chair or to make a costume for endless dancing. After 20 years in this branch, it still makes me happy. <br>Let me make you happy too!<br><br>The service from LN Prints goes much further than just supplying printed fabric.<br>We can think along with you and advise you in the entire process from design to final product.<br>Let\'s make a great product together!<br><br>Ellen Sesink',
